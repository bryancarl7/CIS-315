# DAG
For this assignment we were tasked with processing a text file with an edgelist inside of it for building a graph. Once the graph is built, It will report the longest path that can be found in the DAG and it will also report the number of occurences.

To Run:
python DAG.py < inSamplet.txt

# Dynammic Programming
For this assignment we were tasked with building a dynamic programming function that will correctly insert spaces into a given string of characters (if possible). If it is possible, this program will list every permutation of the given string with spaces inserted into it.

To Run:
1) javac dynProg.java
2) java dynProg < inSampleSmall.txt




--- Both files should contain a short description of the problem and the implementation ---
